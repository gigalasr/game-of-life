This is the first in a series of projects Iâ€™m developing to learn Rust, with a focus on graphics programming. 
For this one, I implemented Conway's Game of Life using [winit](https://crates.io/crates/winit) and [pixels](https://crates.io/crates/pixels) crate. 
The pixels crate was especially helpful, as it provides a simple frame buffer that's easy to draw to. 
I sometimes took a slightly less performant approach on purpose to explore and experiment with different language features. 
The trail effect was inspired by the Conway's Game of Life example from the pixels crateâ€™s GitHub repository.

## ðŸ“– Resources
The following resources helped me to implement this project:

- https://docs.rs/pixels/latest/pixels/
- https://github.com/parasyte/pixels
- https://docs.rs/winit/latest/winit/
- https://github.com/parasyte/pixels/issues/403
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

## ðŸ”® Future Work 
For my next project I plan on implementing Conway's Game of Life on the GPU using wgpu and wgsl.
